## 🎯 Why Run Ads

*"It's not about ideas, it's about making ideas happen."* – Scott Belsky

### Google Search Ads: Capturing Intent at the Perfect Moment
Google Search Ads are your digital storefront for people actively seeking carpentry services. When someone searches "carpenter near me" at 10 PM on a Sunday, your ad can be the first thing they see.

**Key Benefits:**
- **High Intent Traffic**: People are actively looking for your services
- **Local Dominance**: Appear above competitors in your service areas
- **Immediate Results**: Start getting calls within hours of launching
- **Measurable ROI**: Track every rand spent to every job booked

### Meta Ads: Building Trust Before They Need You
Facebook and Instagram ads work differently – they introduce your business to potential customers before they're actively searching, building familiarity and trust.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Visual Showcase**: Display your best work through photos and videos
- **Community Building**: Engage with local homeowners and property developers
- **Retargeting Power**: Stay top-of-mind with website visitors
- **Cost-Effective Reach**: Lower cost per impression than Google

### The Winning Combination
| Google Ads | Meta Ads |
|------------|----------|
| **High intent, higher cost** | **Lower intent, lower cost** |
| **Bottom-funnel targeting** | **Top and mid-funnel awareness** |
| **Text-based ads** | **Visual storytelling** |
| **Immediate conversions** | **Long-term brand building** |

*"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."* – Chinese Proverb

## 🧩 Keyword Strategy for Google Ads

*"Measure twice, cut once."* – Carpenter's Proverb

### High-Intent Local Keywords (Primary Targets)

**Immediate Need Keywords:**
- `carpenter near me`
- `local carpenter [city name]`
- `emergency carpenter Johannesburg`
- `carpenter services Pretoria`

**Service-Specific Keywords:**
- `custom kitchen cabinets Sandton`
- `fitted wardrobes Midrand`
- `bespoke furniture Centurion`
- `finish carpentry Germiston`
- `cabinet making Krugersdorp`
- `built-in cupboards Vanderbijlpark`
- `custom shelving Springs`

**Commercial Intent Keywords:**
- `carpenter quotes [city]`
- `professional carpenter [city]`
- `experienced carpenter [city]`
- `carpenter prices [city]`

### Negative Keywords: Protecting Your Budget

**Essential Negative Keywords:**
- `free` (avoid tire-kickers)
- `DIY` (not your target market)
- `how to` (information seekers, not buyers)
- `jobs` (job seekers, not customers)
- `course` (people wanting to learn carpentry)
- `salary` (employment-related searches)
- `apprenticeship` (training seekers)
- `tools` (people buying equipment, not services)

**Why Negative Keywords Matter:**
Without negative keywords, you'll waste budget on irrelevant clicks. Someone searching "carpenter jobs Johannesburg" isn't looking to hire you – they want to work for you!

*"Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat."* – Sun Tzu

## 🛠️ How to WIN & How to WASTE Money

*"Work smarter, not harder."* – Allan F. Mogensen

### Tactics That WIN 🏆

**Google Ads Winners:**
- Use exact match keywords for high-intent searches
- Enable call extensions for immediate phone contact
- Create location-specific ad groups for each major city
- Bid higher on high-value keywords like "custom kitchen cabinets"
- Schedule ads during business hours when you can answer calls

**Meta Ads Winners:**
- Use high-quality before/after photos in every ad
- Target homeowners aged 30-55 in affluent suburbs
- Create separate campaigns for each service type
- Use video testimonials from satisfied customers
- Retarget website visitors with special offers

### Tactics That BURN Budget 🔥

**Google Ads Budget Killers:**
- Using only broad match keywords (wastes money on irrelevant searches)
- No negative keywords (paying for "DIY carpenter" searches)
- Generic ad copy without location mentions
- Landing on homepage instead of service-specific pages
- Running ads 24/7 when you can't answer calls

**Meta Ads Money Wasters:**
- Targeting "everyone interested in home improvement" (too broad)
- Using stock photos instead of your actual work
- Running ads without a clear call-to-action
- Promoting posts instead of using proper ad objectives
- Not testing different audiences or creative variations

### WIN vs. WASTE Comparison

| Strategy Element | ✅ WIN | ❌ WASTE |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| **Keywords** | "custom kitchen cabinets Sandton" | "home improvement" |
| **Targeting** | Homeowners 30-55, high income areas | Everyone in Gauteng |
| **Ad Creative** | Your actual work photos | Generic stock images |
| **Landing Page** | Service-specific with clear CTA | Homepage with no focus |
| **Budget Timing** | Business hours, peak search times | 24/7 without strategy |
| **Follow-up** | Respond within 30 minutes | Wait until next day |

## 🎯 Tips & Tricks to Improve Results

*"Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection."* – Mark Twain

### Google Ads Optimization Secrets

**Local SEO Integration:**

Measure everything. Test constantly. Respond quickly. Deliver exceptionally.

## 🏆 Learning from Marketing Giants: The Coca-Cola Success Story

*"A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is—it is what consumers tell each other it is."* – Scott Cook

### Why Study Coca-Cola's Marketing Mastery?

Coca-Cola didn't become the world's most valuable brand by accident. Their marketing principles, scaled down and adapted, can transform your local carpentry business. Here's what we can learn:

- **Coca-Cola**: Same red color, same font, same message globally for 137+ years
- **Your Carpentry Business**: Use consistent colors, logos, and messaging across Google Ads, Meta Ads, business cards, and van signage

**2. Emotional Connection Over Product Features**
- **Coca-Cola**: They don't sell sugar water; they sell happiness, sharing, and moments
- **Your Carpentry Business**: Don't just sell "custom cabinets"; sell "the heart of your home where families gather"

**3. Local Relevance with Global Standards**
- **Coca-Cola**: "Share a Coke with [Local Names]" campaign personalized for each country
- **Your Carpentry Business**: Customize ads for each Gauteng city while maintaining quality standards

```

**Lesson 2: Consistency Builds Recognition**

## 🎨 Advanced Creative Strategy: The Coca-Cola Visual Formula

### The Coca-Cola Visual DNA

**Color Psychology in Action:**
- **Red**: Energy, passion, urgency (Coca-Cola's signature)
- **Your Adaptation**: Choose warm wood tones (brown/amber) + accent color (deep blue for trust or green for growth)

**Visual Hierarchy Rules:**
1. **Hero Element** (40% of visual space): Your best work photo
2. **Brand Element** (20% of visual space): Logo and contact info  
3. **Supporting Elements** (40% of visual space): Text, testimonials, CTA

### The "Share a Coke" Campaign for Carpenters

**Original Coca-Cola Campaign:**
"Share a Coke with Sarah" - Personalized bottles with names

**Your Carpentry Adaptation:**
"Built for the Johnson Family" - Showcase projects with family names (with permission)

**Implementation:**
```
Meta Ad Creative:
Image: Beautiful kitchen installation
Text Overlay: "Custom Built for the Morales Family"
Caption: "Every family deserves a kitchen that brings them together. 
What would we build for YOUR family?"
CTA: "Get Your Family's Custom Quote"
```

## 📚 Digital Marketing Dictionary: Simple Terms Explained

*"The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."* – George Bernard Shaw

### 💰 Money & Results Terms

**ROI (Return on Investment)**
- **Simple Definition**: How much money you make compared to how much you spend
- **Formula**: (Revenue - Cost) ÷ Cost × 100
- **Example**: Spend R1,000 on ads → Get R3,000 in jobs → ROI = 200%
- **Good ROI for Carpentry**: 300-500% (R3-R5 back for every R1 spent)

**ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
- **Simple Definition**: Revenue directly from ads divided by ad spend
- **Formula**: Revenue ÷ Ad Spend
- **Example**: R5,000 ad spend → R20,000 in jobs → ROAS = 4:1
- **Target ROAS**: 4:1 to 6:1 for service businesses

**CPL (Cost Per Lead)**
- **Simple Definition**: How much you pay for each potential customer contact
- **Formula**: Total Ad Spend ÷ Number of Leads
- **Example**: R1,500 spent → 15 leads → CPL = R100
- **Good CPL for Carpentry**: R50-R150 per lead

**LTV (Lifetime Value)**
- **Simple Definition**: Total money a customer will spend with you over time
- **Includes**: First job + repeat work + referrals they bring
- **Example**: First kitchen (R25,000) + future projects (R10,000) + 2 referrals (R30,000) = R65,000 LTV
- **Why It Matters**: You can afford higher CPL if LTV is high

### 📊 Performance Measurement Terms

**CTR (Click-Through Rate)**

**CPC (Cost Per Click)**
- **Simple Definition**: How much you pay each time someone clicks your ad
